always being "eot"

- hello (used for registering new nodes with the existing network)
- request (used for propagating a URL trace request from a user)
- result (used for designating results from a previous URL trace request)
- goodbye (used for removing nodes from the network)
- contact (used for telling Node A to establish a connection with Node B)
- okay (used for acknowledging certain request types)
