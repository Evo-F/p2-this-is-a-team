Each request sent is multiple lines long, with the first line always being the type of request, and the last line
always being "eot"
Types of requests are as follows:

- hello (used for registering new nodes with the existing network)
- request (used for propagating a URL trace request from a user)
- result (used for designating results from a previous URL trace request)
- goodbye (used for removing nodes from the network)
- contact (used for telling Node A to establish a connection with Node B, also functions like an OKAY)
- okay (used for acknowledging certain request types)
- heartbeat (used for testing only, to acknowledge a node's presence)
- headcount (used to signify how many nodes are in the network, including the new node if applicable)
- ident (used to request identifying details from each node, to be sent to one node currently serving a webpage)
- report (declares response to an ident query)
