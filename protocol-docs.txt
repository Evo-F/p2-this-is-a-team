Each request sent is multiple lines long, with the first line always being the type of request, and the last line
always being "eot"
Types of requests are as follows:

- hello (used for registering new nodes with the existing network)
- request (used for propagating a URL trace request from a user)
- result (used for designating results from a previous URL trace request)
- goodbye (used for removing nodes from the network)
- contact (used for telling Node A to establish a connection with Node B)
- okay (used for acknowledging certain request types)
- heartbeat (used for testing only, to acknowledge a node's presence)
- ident (used to request identifying details from each node, to be sent to one node currently serving a webpage)
- report (declares response to an ident query)

NOTES ON RESULT:
Within a [result] message, one of the lines represents the returned webpage size in bytes - this is to indicate whether
the targeted URL is serving different webpages based on geographical location. For instances where the targeted URL
sends back negative responses, this number is used instead as an "error code" of sorts.

0: The URL responded with 301
    This is likely an HTTPS redirect (protocol mismatch). The server may not be blocked or misbehaving, it just requires
    HTTPS support which we haven't implemented.
-1: The URL responded with 403
    The server received our request but for whatever reason is not giving access. This is a server-side error response
    so it's unlikely the website is being censored - this is indicative of a server-side blockage, potentially owing to
    geographic location (though not guaranteed).
-2: The URL did not accept the connection in time
    URL either did not respond to our request for a connection or did not hear our request at all. This is probably
    indicative of the host being down/unavailable OR a network-level blockage (not necessarily host's fault).
-3: There was an error accepting the URL's response
    Unspecified error while retrieving the URL's response to our request, could be any number of things, it's probably
    on our side but whatever.
-4: CHUNKED TRANSFER ENCODING!!
    There's nothing wrong with this. We're just not dealing with it.
-5: Invalid URL
    We were unable to get an IP address associated with that URL, so it might be badly formatted.
